    <h2>Panna Cota </h2>

    <!--First Paragraph describing the recipe-->

        <p>A traditional, easy, and delicious Italian custard. 
            I had a difficult time finding a good and easy recipe on 
            the internet, so I made up my own recipe. 
            It tastes just like the panna cotta served at Italian 
            restaurants. 
        </p> 

    <!--Second Paragraph describing the recipe-->

        <p> Serve with warm hot fudge sauce and fresh 
            raspberries on top. This keeps well for several days in 
            the refrigerator </p>

<ol>
    <li>Pour milk into a small bowl, and stir in the gelatin powder. 
        Set aside. </li>
    <li>In a saucepan, stir together the heavy cream and sugar, 
        and set over medium heat. Bring to a full boil, watching carefully, 
        as the cream will quickly rise to the top of the pan. 
        Pour the gelatin and milk into the cream, stirring until 
        completely dissolved. Cook for one minute, stirring constantly. 
        Remove from heat, stir in the vanilla and pour into six individual 
        ramekin dishes.</li>
    <li>Cool the ramekins uncovered at room temperature. When cool, cover
         with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, 
         but preferably overnight before serving.</li>
</ol>
